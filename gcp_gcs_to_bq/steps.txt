Step 1: Create Cloud Storage Buckets
        Create Two Buckets:
            Input Bucket (Landing Zone): This bucket will store the input CSV files.
            Processing Bucket: This bucket will be used for uploading the JavaScript (JS) and JSON files needed for the function, as well as for storing metadata and temporary files.

        Upload Files:
            Upload the necessary JS and JSON files to the Processing Bucket.

Step 2: Set Up BigQuery
        Create a BigQuery Dataset:
            Set up a dataset in BigQuery to store your tables.

        Create a Table:
            Within the dataset, create a table to store the processed data from the input CSV files.

Step 3: Automate the Data Pipeline with Dataflow
        Create a Dataflow Job:
            Set up a Dataflow job that automates the processing of data.
            Configure the Dataflow job to be triggered whenever a new file is uploaded to the Input Bucket.

        Specify File Path:
            Ensure the Dataflow job can access the file path of the uploaded CSV files in the Input Bucket.

Step 4: Create a Cloud Function to Trigger Dataflow
        Develop Cloud Function:
            Create a Cloud Function that will trigger the Dataflow job.
            This function should be configured to respond to events from the Input Bucket (e.g., file upload events).
        
        Integrate Cloud Function with Dataflow:
            In the Cloud Function, include logic to invoke the Dataflow job with the appropriate parameters and file paths.
